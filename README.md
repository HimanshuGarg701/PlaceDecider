## Place Decider Application
### Summary:
Place Decider Application was my first android project. The functionality of Place Decider is to simply display the name of a place as soon as you click the Select button.
### Implementation:
### Main Activity Page
Main Activity page displays the name of a place from a self-created mutableList. Whenever you click on the select button, the displayed place changes for some other location from the list. If you are fed up with limited number of location, you can always add new places of your interest on the click of add button. 
### Second Activity page
Since you can always update the list of places. So, whenever you click the submit place button, you are referred to a new page which displays that you can go to place(whatever location submitted by the user). Your list will be updated.
### Third Activity Page
There is a third activity page which can be accessed whenever you click the check places button. The functionality is basically to display the list of all the places present inside the list. The list is displayed with the help of Recycler view.
